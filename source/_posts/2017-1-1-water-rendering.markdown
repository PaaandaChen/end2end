# Abstract

We successfuly rendered the water on our [webpage](https://naughtychen.cc/ICG_HW/) using ray-marching method based on WebGL. The ocean is simulated by ridged multi-fractal algorithm. We also added a floating ball to test the reflection and refraction of the water. And a VR mode to watch it on your mobile device with Google Cardboard.

# Features
- Water Rendering
- Ray-marching
- VR mode
