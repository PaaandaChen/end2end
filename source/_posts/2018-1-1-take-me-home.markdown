This is a Game Project we made using Unity 5. We created the map based on real Taipeiroads. Player should guide characters to their homes as quick as possible.  

Every character's *destination* was randomly generated, during the game you need to control where each player goes at each corner, or they will go any place as they want. If characters ran into each other at the road, they will talk (or fight if they are both dogs) for a while. And there will even be ghosts in the night!

So, guide them home as quick as possible, if there are too many characters on the map you will lose the game.
