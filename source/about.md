# Introduction
---
Hi~ my name is Zhuohan Chen, you can also call me Panda.  
I’m currently a master student at National Taiwan University, Taipei. I received my bachelor’s degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, majoring in Computer Science. After that I worked at Shanghai for Xitian and Virtuos for one year as a software engineer.  
My research interests include Computer Graphics, Physical Based Rendering, VR/AR and other interesting stuff. Right now I’m figuring on how Computer Graphics or Physical Based Rendering can benefit by Machine Learning.
